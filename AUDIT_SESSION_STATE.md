## üìã Audit Methodology & Standards Applied

### Severity Rubric Used
- **Critical (20-25)**: L:4-5 √ó I:4-5 (fix before release)
- **High (12-19)**: L:3-4 √ó I:3-4 (‚â§ 1 week)
- **Medium (6-11)**: L:2-3 √ó I:2-3 (‚â§ 1 sprint)
- **SLA Policy**: No shipping with open Critical issues

### Analysis Approach
- **Static analysis only** - no code execution
- **Evidence-based findings** - exact file:line references
- **Exploitability focus** - step-by-step attack scenarios
- **OWASP/CWE mapping** - industry standard references
- **Proposed diffs** - concrete remediation code (as text, not applied)

## üö® **CRITICAL FINDINGS SUMMARY** 

### CRIT-001: Complete Authorization Bypass
- **File**: `src/app/game/actions.ts` (multiple functions)
- **Issue**: Server actions lack basic auth checks
- **Impact**: Any player can access/control any room
- **Exploitability**: Trivial - direct API calls with any gameId

### CRIT-002: Host Validation Logic Bypass  
- **File**: `src/app/game/actions.ts:752-758`
- **Issue**: Uses unreliable `ready_player_order[0]` instead of `created_by_player_id`
- **Impact**: Non-host players can perform host actions
- **Exploitability**: Join game, become ready first, gain host powers

### CRIT-003: Player Identity Forgery
- **File**: `src/contexts/SharedGameContext.tsx:78-92`
- **Issue**: Player identity stored in unprotected localStorage
- **Impact**: Complete player impersonation possible
- **Exploitability**: Copy victim's localStorage player ID

---

## üéØ **Architecture Analysis Completed**

### Threat Model & Trust Boundaries
- **Browser** (Untrusted) ‚Üî **Next.js Server** (Semi-trusted) ‚Üî **Supabase** (Trusted)
- **Trust Boundary 1**: Client-Server (major vulnerabilities found)
- **Trust Boundary 2**: Server-Database (RLS not yet audited)

### Top 10 Abuse Cases Identified
1. Cross-room access via gameId manipulation
2. Host privilege escalation via ready order
3. Judge privilege abuse in game actions
4. Session hijacking via localStorage theft
5. Room code brute force enumeration
6. Game state manipulation during wrong phases
7. Card pool timing attacks
8. Multi-room participation abuse
9. Score manipulation bypassing business logic
10. XSS via malicious player names

### Room Code Security Assessment
- **Current Entropy**: 30 bits (32^6 = 1.07B combinations)
- **Vulnerability**: Brute force feasible (~3 hours at 100 req/sec)
- **Character Set**: ‚úÖ Good (excludes confusing 0,O,1,I)
- **Rate Limiting**: ‚ùå None implemented

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **USER VERIFICATION REQUIRED**

### Context for Return
- **User Statement**: "I've run some checks that don't line up with your findings"
- **Action Needed**: User will provide counter-evidence to audit findings
- **Next Steps**: 
  1. Review user's verification results
  2. Reconcile any discrepancies with findings
  3. Update audit conclusions if needed
  4. Determine if Phase 2 should proceed or findings need revision

### Questions to Address on Return
1. Which specific findings do the user's checks contradict?
2. What testing methodology did the user employ?
3. Are there authorization controls not visible in static analysis?
4. Are there RLS policies or middleware not captured in the audit?
5. Should severity assessments be adjusted based on user evidence?

## üìÅ **Files Analyzed (Phase 1)**

### Core Security Files Audited
- ‚úÖ `src/app/game/actions.ts` (1468 lines) - **18 server actions analyzed**
- ‚úÖ `src/lib/roomCodes.ts` (226 lines) - **Room code generation & validation**
- ‚úÖ `src/lib/types.ts` (119 lines) - **Type definitions & client state**
- ‚úÖ `src/contexts/SharedGameContext.tsx` (457 lines) - **Session management**

### Specific Functions Analyzed for Authorization
1. `findOrCreateGame()` - ‚úÖ No auth needed (public)
2. `getGame(gameId)` - ‚ùå No player validation  
3. `addPlayer()` - ‚úÖ Reasonable (creates new player)
4. `getGameByRoomCode()` - ‚ùå No access control
5. `startGame()` - ‚ùå Weak host validation
6. `selectCategory()` - ‚ùå No judge validation
7. `submitResponse()` - ‚ùå No player membership check
8. `selectWinner()` - ‚ùå No judge validation
9. `nextRound()` - ‚ùå No authorization
10. `togglePlayerReadyStatus()` - ‚ùå No player ownership check
11. `removePlayerFromGame()` - ‚ùå No authorization check
12. `resetGameForTesting()` - ‚ùå No authorization (dangerous)
13. `getCurrentPlayer()` - ‚ùå Returns any player data
14. `createRoom()` - ‚úÖ No auth needed (creates new)
15. `cleanupEmptyRooms()` - ‚úÖ Background job (no auth needed)
16. `findAvailableRoomForQuickJoin()` - ‚úÖ Public discovery (reasonable)
17. `handleJudgeApprovalForCustomCard()` - ‚ùå No judge validation
18. `dealCardsFromSupabase()` - Internal utility (not directly exposed)

## üîß **Analysis Tools & Commands Used**

### Search Patterns Applied
- Service-role key exposure: `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY|service_role`
- Secret leakage: `api_key|password|secret|token|credential`  
- XSS vectors: `dangerouslySetInnerHTML|innerHTML`
- SQL injection: `select.*\+|SELECT.*\+|\$\{.*\}.*select`
- Auth bypasses: Manual analysis of each server action
- Session handling: localStorage usage patterns

### Code Quality Observations
- **TypeScript Usage**: ‚úÖ Good type safety throughout
- **Error Handling**: ‚úÖ Comprehensive error logging and user feedback
- **Database Queries**: ‚úÖ Proper parameterized queries via Supabase client
- **Code Organization**: ‚úÖ Well-structured, clear separation of concerns
- **Performance**: Some parallel query optimization observed

## üìä **Audit Statistics**

### Files Read: 7 primary files
### Code Lines Analyzed: ~3,000 lines  
### Server Actions Audited: 18 functions
### Security Patterns Checked: 15 attack vectors
### Findings Generated: 5 (3 Critical, 2 High)
### Evidence Snippets: 12 code examples with line numbers
### Remediation Proposals: 5 detailed implementation guides

---

## üéØ **When Resuming**

### Immediate Actions
1. **Review user's counter-evidence** against findings CRIT-001, CRIT-002, CRIT-003
2. **Validate or refute** each Critical finding based on user testing
3. **Update severity scores** if authorization controls exist but weren't visible in static analysis
4. **Decide next phase**: Continue to Phase 2 or revise Phase 1 conclusions

### Context to Maintain
- All findings are based on **static code analysis only**
- **No runtime testing** was performed by the audit
- **RLS policies** and middleware may provide controls not visible in application code
- **User's practical testing** may reveal security controls that static analysis missed

### Questions for User
1. Which findings specifically don't match your testing results?
2. What authorization controls are in place that weren't captured?
3. Are there database-level security policies (RLS) that enforce access control?
4. Should we proceed with Phase 2 or revise the security assessment first?
