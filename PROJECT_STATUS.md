*Last Updated: August 26, 2025*

### 🎯 Core Functionality

**✅ Room Creation & Management**
- Create public/private rooms with custom names
- Automatic 6-character room code generation
- Room joining via codes or direct links

**✅ Multi-Player Coordination**  
- Real-time player state synchronization via Supabase

**✅ Game Flow**
- Complete game cycle: Lobby → Category Selection → Player Submission → Judging → Results
- Judge rotation system
- Card dealing and hand management
- Scoring and winner determination

**✅ Reset Functionality**
