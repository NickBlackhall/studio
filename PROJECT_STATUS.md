# Multi-Player Game Project Status

## Current Status: ✅ STABLE & FUNCTIONAL

*Last Updated: August 26, 2025*

### 🎯 Core Functionality

**✅ Room Creation & Management**
- Create public/private rooms with custom names
- Automatic 6-character room code generation
- Room joining via codes or direct links

**✅ Multi-Player Coordination**  
- Real-time player state synchronization via Supabase
- Up to 8 players per room
- Player ready status and game progression coordination

**✅ Game Flow**
- Complete game cycle: Lobby → Category Selection → Player Submission → Judging → Results
- Judge rotation system
- Card dealing and hand management
- Scoring and winner determination

**✅ Reset Functionality**
- **FULLY OPERATIONAL** - Reset button works without crashes
- Multi-player coordinated reset (all players see reset notification)
- Clean state transitions back to lobby
- Automatic navigation to main menu

**✅ Host & Player Management** *(Implemented - August 2025)*
- **Host Room Ownership** - Room creator becomes permanent host (`created_by_player_id`)
- **Host Visual Indicators** - Crown (👑) emoji shows host in all player lists
- **Host-Only Dev Console** - Secure access to player management tools (development mode)
- **Player Kicking System** - Host can remove disruptive players with proper notifications
- **Player Removal System** - Clean database cleanup when players exit voluntarily or are kicked
- **Host Departure Handling** - When host leaves, room closes for all players with coordinated transition
- **Judge Reassignment** - Automatic rotation when current judge leaves mid-game
- **Lobby Reset Logic** - Game returns to lobby when <2 players remain (e.g., 2-player kick scenario)
- **Multi-Player Coordination** - Uses proven transition state system for real-time notifications
- **Toast Notifications** - Success/error feedback for hosts, notification toasts for kicked players

### 🛠️ System Features

**✅ Automatic Room Cleanup**
- Empty rooms automatically deleted after 10 minutes
- Prevents database bloat from abandoned games
- Triggers on room creation and browsing

**✅ Development Environment**
- GitHub Codespaces fully supported
- Next.js 15.2.3 with TypeScript
- Supabase integration for real-time data
- Comprehensive error handling

**✅ Testing Infrastructure**
- Playwright e2e test suite (162 tests)
- Unit and integration test coverage
- Multi-player simulation capabilities

### 🚀 Recent Major Fixes (Aug 26, 2025)

1. **React Hooks Violation Resolved** - Fixed component crashes during reset
2. **Server Actions Working** - Resolved GitHub Codespaces host header issues  
3. **Cleanup System Restored** - Re-enabled automatic room maintenance
4. **Multi-Player Coordination** - Validated reset works across all connected players

### 🏗️ Architecture

**Frontend**: Next.js App Router, React 18, TypeScript
**Backend**: Next.js Server Actions, Supabase Edge Functions  
**Database**: Supabase PostgreSQL with real-time subscriptions
**State Management**: React Context with Supabase integration
**Testing**: Playwright, Jest, React Testing Library

### 📝 Development Notes

- All critical functionality is operational and tested
- Reset button issues documented in `/workspaces/studio/CLAUDE.md` have been fully resolved
- System ready for continued feature development
- Performance validated with multi-player scenarios

### ⚠️ Immediate Testing Needs

**Host Management System**: Implementation complete, but requires manual verification

**Critical Tests Needed**:
1. **Host Creation Flow** - Verify first player gets crown (👑) and host powers
2. **Dev Console Access** - Test Menu → Dev Console flow, verify host-only access  
3. **Player Kicking** - Test kick button functionality, success/error toasts, multi-player coordination
4. **Visual Indicators** - Confirm crown appears in all player lists and UI
5. **Edge Cases** - 2-player kick → lobby reset, host departure behavior

**Testing Commands**:
```bash
# Start dev server
npm run dev

# Create game with 2+ players
# HOST: Menu → Dev Console → PIN: 6425 → Test kick functionality
# Verify host sees crown (👑) and kick buttons for other players only
```
